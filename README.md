Analyze and visualize sentiment patterns in social media data to understand public opinion and attitudes towards specific topics or brands.
In this project, I conducted sentiment analysis on social media data to uncover public attitudes and opinions towards specific topics or brands. By analyzing a diverse dataset spanning platforms like Twitter and Facebook, I utilized natural language processing techniques to classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral. Visualizations such as sentiment distribution plots and word clouds were employed to illustrate dominant sentiment trends and key themes. This project provides actionable insights into understanding public perception, guiding strategic decision-making for businesses and organizations.

Key Skills Demonstrated:

Social media data scraping and preprocessing
Sentiment analysis using NLP techniques
Data visualization with Python (matplotlib, seaborn)
Interpretation of sentiment trends and insights
This project showcases my proficiency in data analysis and visualization, offering valuable insights into consumer sentiment for informed business strategies.
